Hyperion
========

In this small project, I used data of more than 30000 job offers from a job portal, to create a simple page using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angularjs and Nodejs).

You can check out how I got the data, scapping and crawling the portal [infojobs](http://www.infojobs.net/) in here: [scrawlper](https://github.com/MagikInside/scrawlper).

For this project I used:

+ MEAN Stack
+ [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
+ [Angular-charts](https://github.com/chinmaymk/angular-charts)



## How to use

1. Clone the project:

```
     $git clone https://github.com/MagikInside/hyperion.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
     $cd hyperion
```

```
     $npm install
```

3. Start:

```
     $ node app.js
```

> The program will process 1520 pages, so it will be running for a while before ending. Be patient. Then it will create a file "output.json" with the result.
